    <h3>M.A @ Seoul National University</h3>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The TELD lab at Seoul National University aims to design meaningful learning environments with cutting-edge technologies and theories in formal and informal learning contexts.
    </p>
    <strong>
        The TELD has four research focuses:
        <ol>
        <li>online learning environments</li>
        <li>authentic learning and problem solving</li>
        <li>computer-supported collaborative learning</li>
        <li>learning analytics and personalized learning</li>
        </ol>
    </strong>
    <p>We have conducted several studies to design
    rning ets for proble
    ed learning, collaborative learning, and si,
    learning. In addition, we have investigated how
    le learn in online environments through applying mixed-methods red learning analytics, which often leads to the new design of instruction and learning. </p>
